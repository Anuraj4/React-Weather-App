# React-Weather-App
Description:

Build a weather application that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for a
given location. The front-end should be developed using React.js, and the back-end API should

4. Provided a 5-day weather forecast for the location.
5. Used appropriate styling to enhance the user interface.
6. You can use an existing




Additional Consideration:

1. Used React hooks for state management.
2. Used a functional component approach in React.
3. Ensure the code is modular and well-organized.

Features:

1. Added a feature to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units.
2. Implemented geolocation to automatically fetch the weather for the user's current location.
3. Allow users to save their favorite locations and view the weather for those locations.
4. Added a loading indicator while fetching weather data.
